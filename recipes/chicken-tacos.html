            Ingredients:
            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup water</li>
                <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>
                <li>2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons white distilled vinegar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground oregano</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
                <li>8 taco shells, warmed</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Steps:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Mix water and taco seasoning in a large bowl. 
                    Add tomato sauce, vinegar, garlic, oregano, cumin, and sugar; mix well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                    Add chicken and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.
                    Add tomato sauce mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes.
                    An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove chicken breasts from the pan and shred meat with 2 forks when cool enough to handle. 
                    Return shredded chicken to the pan with the tomato sauce. 
                    Cook and stir until chicken is coated with sauce and sauce reduces a bit, about 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transfer chicken and sauce to a serving bowl and spoon onto taco shells.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
