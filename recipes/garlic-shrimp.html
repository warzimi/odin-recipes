            Steps:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                    Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
                     Drain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat 1 tablespoon butter and vegetable oil large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. 
                    Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. 
                    Add shrimp, 2 tablespoons parsley, and dill. 
                    Cook and stir, flipping shrimp halfway, until pink, 3 to 4 minutes. 
                    Move shrimp to a plate and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the skillet, stirring into the shrimp juices. 
                    Add flour; whisk until fully combined and starting to turn golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. 
                    Add chicken broth and milk in that order; whisk to combine. 
                    Stir in tomatoes, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. 
                    Bring sauce to a simmer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and Romano cheese into the sauce until cheeses begin to melt and sauce is creamy. 
                    Add 1 tablespoon mozzarella cheese. 
                    Mix in about 1/2 the cooked penne to start; add more if there is enough sauce to coat. 
                    Add the shrimp and stir to combine. Top with the remaining parsley, Parmesan, and mozzarella.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven and bake until top is golden and sauce bubbles around the edges of the skillet, 8 to 10 minutes.
